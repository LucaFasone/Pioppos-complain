# Pioppo's Complaint (NOT SURE IF IT STILL WORKS)


This is a simple app I created for my girlfriend, allowing her to send me emails and "rate" me. The app is deployed using Firebase, with Firebase also handling the database. For sending emails, I used EmailJS to set up an SMTP-like service since Firebase's free plan doesn't allow API calls required for a real SMTP server.

## Features

- **Email Sending:** Users can send emails using a custom form.
- **Rating System:** Users can rate using a predefined rating system.
- **Firebase Integration:** Firebase is used for deployment and database.
- **EmailJS Integration:** EmailJS is used to handle the email-sending functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Firebase (Database & Hosting)
- **Email Service:** EmailJS
